Human Reader

A chrome extension that uses elevenlabs.io to let you listen to any text on the web. This was a weekend project, so consider it beta. Any feedback or contributions are welcome! 

The extension is avaliable here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/human-reader/klohmfhfijipahknljjelpfgjpmandmg
