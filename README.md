# Human Reader

A Chrome extension that uses the elevenlabs.io API to let you listen to any text on the web. This was a weekend project, so consider it beta. Any feedback or contributions are welcome! 

The extension is available here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/human-reader/klohmfhfijipahknljjelpfgjpmandmg

Version 1.1 (what you see in this repo) is still being reviewed by Chrome and not avaliable yet under the link above. 

Check out the demo here:
